* Fixed - an issue with a significant delay to fetch initial results when using ajax (with shortcode) - initial results are now loaded server side on page load
* Fixed - bad html and "hide_empty" was not working as expected - it was disabling inputs rather than hiding them
* Fixed - i18n for "prev" and "next" in pagination
* Fixed - post date field was not working correctly when using ajax w/ shortcodes
* Improved - integration with WPML - better URLs and works fully with shortcodes
* Removed - *Beta* Auto Count - this feature is likely to be even more broken (it had plenty of bugs already) - it is recommended you disable this for now.  The next major update will inlcude a revised & working version of this.
