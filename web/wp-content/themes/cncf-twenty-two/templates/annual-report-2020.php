There is no fixed amount of investment, mindshare, or development contribution allocated to specific projects. Just as open source development is based on the idea that, collectively, we are smarter than any one of us, open source foundations work for the betterment of the entire community. </p>

Dan was one of the great open source leaders of our time, a brilliant mind –&nbsp; devoted to giving back to the community, and a loving husband and father who will truly be missed forever.</p>
				<p>Dan’s lifelong desire was to help others. From serving as a volunteer firefighter in college to founding <a href="http://lfph.io">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> at the height of the pandemic to assist in the worldwide fight against COVID-19, he never stopped finding ways to make a positive and lasting impact. We are forever grateful for Dan’s many contributions and accomplishments and will continue to honor his legacy of constant collaboration, sharing, and compassion in everything that we do.</p>

Cloud native technologies are also driving the expansion of the <a href="https://www.cloudpro.co.uk/leadership/cloud-essentials/8834/the-role-of-cloud-native-at-the-edge">“Wild West” of edge computing</a> with many firms realizing the “financial benefits to taking the cloud native path”.</p>
		<p

This diversity is at the heart of the open source movement. Together we are stronger, faster, better, and more innovative than alone and apart, and that diversity makes us more resilient to weather any challenge — even the loss of a great leader.&nbsp;</p>
		<p

Continue connecting end users and advocating for knowledge sharing and collaboration.” Among respondents, 100% would recommend CNCF to other companies, and <strong>the average satisfaction rating was 4.47 out of 5 (89%), up from 4.16 out of 5 in 2019 (83%)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

		<h3 id="open-source-security-audits">CNCF Open Source Security Audits
		</h3>
		<p
			class="is-style-default">In 2018, the CNCF began performing and open sourcing security audits for its projects to improve the security of our ecosystem. </p>
		<p
			class="is-style-default">The goal was to audit several projects and gather feedback from the CNCF community as to whether the pilot program was useful. The first projects to undergo this process were <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-security-audit/findings/Kubernetes%20Final%20Report.pdf">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://coredns.io/2018/03/15/cure53-security-assessment/">CoreDNS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf">Envoy</a>. In 2019, CNCF invested in security audits for Vitess, Jaeger, Fluentd, Linkerd, Falco, Harbor, gRPC, Helm, and Kubernetes, totaling approximately half a million dollars. These first public audits identified a variety of security issues, ranging from general weaknesses to critical vulnerabilities. Project maintainers for CoreDNS, Envoy, and Prometheus have addressed the identified vulnerabilities and added documentation to help users, thus improving the security of these projects.</p>
		<p
			class="is-style-default">With funds provided by the CNCF community to conduct the Kubernetes security audit, the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-security-audit">Security Audit Working Group</a> was formed to lead the process of finding a reputable third-party vendor. The group created an open request for proposals. The group took responsibility for evaluating the proposals and recommending the vendor best suited to complete a security assessment against Kubernetes, bearing in mind the project’s high complexity and broad scope.</p>
		<p
			class="is-style-default">This audit process was partially inspired by the <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en">Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Best Practices Badge program</a> that all CNCF projects are required to complete. Provided by the Linux Foundation, this badge offers a clear and easy-to-understand way for open source projects to show that they follow security best practices. Adopters of open source software can use the badge to quickly assess which open source projects are following best practices, and as a result, are more likely to produce higher-quality, secure software.</p>
		<p
			class="is-style-max-width-100">Findings from the Kubernetes audit conducted over a few months revealed:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Key security policies may not be applied, leading to a false
				sense of
				security.</li>
			<li>Insecure TLS is in use by default.</li>
			<li>Credentials are exposed in environment variables and
				command-line
				arguments.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Names of secrets are leaked in logs.</li>
			<li>Kubernetes lacked certificate revocation.</li>
			<li>seccomp is not enabled by default.</li>
		</ol>
		<p
			class="is-style-default">By open sourcing security audits and processes, the working group hopes to inspire other projects to undertake similar efforts in their respective open source communities.

				<p>CNCF has grown from a few members in China in 2015 to over 50 in 2020. That number&nbsp; includes four Platinum (20% of Platinum members), six Gold (27% of Gold members), 55 Silver (nearly 8% of Silver members), and two End User Supporters (2% of End User Supporters).

Some 49% of respondents now use containers in production, with another 32% planning to do so. This is a significant increase from November 2018 when only 20% used containers in production. Further, 72% of respondents in China use Kubernetes in production, up from 40% in November 2018.

The success of CNCF is directly attributable to our projects, the contributions of the community, our end users, and support from our member companies. Thank you!&nbsp;</p>
		<p
			class="is-style-default">As we look to 2021 and beyond, we remain committed to fostering and sustaining an ecosystem<strong> </strong>of open source, vendor-neutral projects, and to making technology accessible for everyone. To thrive, we believe CNCF must continue to provide a neutral home for projects, encourage diversity, and continue to cultivate community. All three are crucial elements for growth.</p>
		<p
			class="is-style-default">By continuing a wide array of initiatives, such as security audits, project journey reports, and documentation improvements, we are investing in the community to strengthen the cloud native ecosystem. We will continue with our core strategy of focusing on the developer community, helping developers progress into contributor and maintainer roles, and offering educational opportunities for those looking to grow and learn.</p>
		<p
			class="is-style-default">Previously, in-person learning opportunities were offered at our flagship KubeCon + CloudNativeCon events. We are now aggressively expanding these learning opportunities through virtual and hybrid events. We plan to expand our events, especially community ones,both initiatives in 2021 to continue supporting community learning.</p>
		<p
			class="is-style-default">Our sincere hope is that the CNCF community will continue to evolve as more and more new people join the ecosystem, thus furthering diversity and collaboration. We see signs of this as first-time attendees made up 69% of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America Virtual 2020. In 2021, we will also be launching a member referral program that will help support the growth and diversity of our community.</p>
		<p
			class="is-style-default">We also will continue to emphasize the growth of our end user community, with new initiatives such as the CNCF End User Technology Radar sharing the real experiences, feedback, and opinions of end users. We will continue our work to bring end users together to discuss best practices in the Telco, Research, and Financial Services sectors.</p>
		<p
			class="is-style-max-width-800 has-header-4-font-size">In summary, 2020 was an exceptional year for CNCF. We are well-positioned financially and organizationally to continue our mission to make cloud native computing ubiquitous and the de facto standard for software development and usage. We look forward to having you join us on this journey as we look to 2021 and beyond. </p>
