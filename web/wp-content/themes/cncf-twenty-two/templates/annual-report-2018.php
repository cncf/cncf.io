Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach. </span>

								A basic premise behind CNCF, our
								<a href="http://www.kubecon.io/">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon</a>
								conferences, and open source in general is that many interactions are positive sum – making everyone involved better off – rather than zero sum, where there would be winners and losers. There is not a fixed amount of investment, mindshare, or development contributions that gets allocated between projects. Just as open source development is based on the idea that collectively we are smarter than any one of us, open source foundations work to make the entire community better off.
								</p>
										<p>CNCF is committed to building sustainable ecosystems by hosting great open source projects. Companies use those projects and build commercial products and services, creating value in the form of profits. They can then reinvest a portion of the profits in the projects by funding developers, which results in more code, more improvements, and better products. This creates a virtuous cycle of investment, innovation, and economic activity.</p>

								<span style="font-weight: 400;">, held December 10-13, 2018, was our biggest yet and was sold out several weeks ahead of time with 8,000 attendees.</span>
								</p>
										<p>
								<span style="font-weight: 400;">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon co-chair Liz Rice of Aqua Security gave a CNCF community update, alongside a number of our project maintainers, including a Helm update from Michelle Noorali of Microsoft and an Envoy update from Matt Klein of Lyft.</span>
								</p>
										<p>
								<span style="font-weight: 400;">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Seattle attendance increased 90% from last year’s KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America event in Austin. And while the attendee numbers grew, the great developer conference experience remained the same.</span>

											<p>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon co-chair Janet Kuo of Google explained that Kubernetes being boring was a good thing. As co-chair Liz Rice of Aqua Security said: “CNCF is not here to throw glitzy events, but to help us coordinate as a community and ensure we have proper governance in place.” Kelsey Hightower gave a shout out to the amazing real women of Hidden Figures, his mom, and the Queen of Motown, Diana Ross, in his serverless keynote.</p>

									The co-chairs select a program committee of around 80 experts, including project maintainers, active community members, and highly-rated presenters from past events, to review the CFP submissions. The keynote speakers are selected by the conference co-chairs from highly-rated CFP submissions, or in rare cases, by invitation from the co-chairs.

										<h3>Project Maturity Levels</h3>
										<div class="copy-wrp">
											<p>
									CNCF projects have a maturity level of sandbox, incubating, or graduated. CNCF uses these maturity levels to signal to enterprises which projects they should adopt. Graduated projects are suitable for the vast majority of all enterprises. Incubating projects are suitable for early adopters, and sandbox projects are for innovators. Projects increase their maturity level by demonstrating to the TOC that they have adoption, healthy rate of changes, and committers from multiple organizations as well as adopting the CNCF
									<a href="https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a>
									and earning the Core Infrastructure Initiative
									<a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/">Best Practices Badge</a>

										<p>Education, inclusion, and collaboration are vital to the future of the cloud native ecosystem.</p>

								Part of supporting the continued development of this amazing community is making sure that everyone who wants to participate feels welcome to do so regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or economic status. While having more female speakers at
								<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Seattle</a>
								was an important step forward, there were a number of other activities that brought together the diversity of the cloud native community: speed networking and mentoring, the diversity lunch, sessions on building a community through Meetups, and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon diversity scholarships.
								</p>
										<p>
								CNCF’s diversity program offered scholarships to 147 recipients from traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized groups to attend
								<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Seattle</a>
								. These scholarships cover both the cost of the ticket as well as airfare and lodging. The $300,000 for Seattle, the largest investment made by a conference in diversity, was mainly contributed by CNCF, along with donations from Aspen Mesh, MongoDB, Twistlock, Two Sigma, and VMware. Including Seattle, CNCF has to date offered more than 485 diversity scholarships to attend KubeCon + CloudNativeCon events.
								</p>
										<p>
								CNCF collaborated with the Kubernetes mentoring program to offer networking opportunities for mentees at
								<a href="http://www.kubecon.io/">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon</a>

								In 2016,
								<a href="http://deis.io/">Deis</a>
								(now part of Microsoft) Platform Architect Matt Butcher was looking for a way to explain Kubernetes to technical and non-technical people alike. Inspired by his daughter’s prolific stuffed animal collection, he came up with the idea of
								<em>
								<a href="https://www.cncf.io/phippy/the-childrens-illustrated-guide-to-kubernetes/">The Illustrated Children’s Guide to Kubernetes</a>
								</em>
								. Thus Phippy, the yellow giraffe and PHP application, along with her friends, were born.

								On the keynote stage during Day 1 of the

								starting in mid-2017 in response to requests from the Kubernetes Steering Committee and SIG-Contributor Experience to provide insight into how Kubernetes was dealing with nearly unprecedented growth. (It’s the second-largest community in open source, behind only Linux.) The tool, which is open source, downloads several terabytes of
								<a href="https://www.gharchive.org/">data</a>
								representing every public GitHub action of the last 5 years, throws out nearly all of it except for the ~100 repos of CNCF-hosted projects, processes the data and stores it in a

								database, and then displays it using
								<a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>
								dashboards. DevStats now covers all CNCF-hosted projects and downloads updated data every hour. More recently, we have been iterating on several versions of a project status
								<a href="https://all.devstats.cncf.io/d/53/projects-health?orgId=1">dashboard</a>

									<h2>CNCF Landscape And Cloud Native Trail
										Map
									</h2>
									<p>
								The CNCF Cloud Native
								<a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">Landscape</a>
								is intended as a map through the previously uncharted terrain of cloud native technologies. The landscape started in November 2016 as a static image of fewer than 100 projects and products. It has grown through the power of collaborative editing to track more than 600 items and now includes a
								<a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/serverless">serverless</a>
								landscape. The project has more than 4,000 stars on GitHub.
							</p>
									<p>
								In March 2018, CNCF released the Cloud Native
								<a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">Landscape</a>
								2.0, an interactive version that allows viewers to filter, obtain detailed information on a specific project or technology, and easily share via stateful URLs. The interactive landscape is open source with the data stored in a
								<a href="https://github.com/cncf/landscape/blob/master/landscape.yml">yaml</a>
								file. Every night, a server downloads updated GitHub data, financing information from Crunchbase, market cap data from Yahoo Finance, and CII
								<a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en">Best Practices</a>
								Badge information.

									, which provides an overview for enterprises starting their cloud native journey. While there are innumerable routes for deploying a cloud native application, CNCF projects represent a particularly well-traveled, tested, and trusted path.
								</p>
											<p>No matter the exact path each organization chooses to travel on its way to becoming cloud native, the goal of these new interactive and introductory guides is to help a company progress on its cloud native journey.</p>

								CNCF also maintains a
								<a href="https://github.com/cncf/artwork/">repository</a>
								of project logos in standard formats, shapes, and colors. There are 3 formats (PNG/SVG/AI), 3 layouts – horizontal (also known as landscape format), stacked (which is closer to square), and icon (which does not include the name and is square) – and 3 versions (color/black/white), which results in 27 versions of each logo.

								<h2>Test Conformance Projects</h2>
								<div class="conformance-projects-container">
									<p>
								The
								<a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/">Certified Kubernetes</a>
								software conformance program relies on the open source conformance tests included in each version of Kubernetes. However, these tests are not as comprehensive as the community would like, as they don’t yet cover all stable APIs. CNCF has been investing in test development to add conformance tests, particularly for portions of the API that get heavily exercised by different Kubernetes implementations. Philosophically, CNCF generally avoids hiring engineers because we don’t want to compete with our members. We made an exception in this case to try to address some of the technical debt of having features in the stable API without corresponding conformance tests.
							</p>
									<p>
								In 2018, CNCF negotiated a software development contract with a well-regarded test development company, Globant, to have 2 engineers work full-time on conformance test development. All tests are submitted as PRs and approved through the normal SIG-Testing review process and with approval from SIG-Architecture. Additionally, after
								<a href="https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-k8s-conformance/message/358">consultation</a>
								with CNCF staff, SIGArchitecture promulgated a new
								<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1806/files">requirement</a>
								that new features in Kubernetes require conformance tests before becoming part of the
								<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/">stable API</a>
								. Thus, this test development is intended to focus on paying off the past technical debt rather than an indefinite, ongoing commitment of resources.

										<h3>Apisnoop</h3>

								<a href="https://apisnoop.cncf.io/">APISnoop</a>

An initial goal is to provide a useful indicator as to which Kubernetes APIs are used the most and don’t yet have conformance tests. This ensures we are testing APIs that are relevant. The output below is one visualization of how API groups’ endpoints and verbs are used today.

								<h2>Looking Forward To 2019</h2>
								<div class="looking-forward-container">
									<p class="forward-larger">Quite possibly, no software foundation has ever had a more successful year than CNCF did in 2018. The success of CNCF is directly attributable to the contributions and support of member companies,
								developer
								community, and end users. We are very grateful for that.
							</p>
									<p>
								CNCF is committed to
								<strong>fostering and sustaining an ecosystem</strong>
								of open source, vendor-neutral projects by democratizing state-of-the-art patterns to make technology accessible for everyone.
							</p>
									<p>
								Through initiatives like conformance test development, documentation improvements, and security audits, we are reinvesting the proceeds from membership and conferences into making the
								<strong>cloud native platform more reliable</strong>
								.
							</p>
									<p>
								Our core strategy in 2019 is to stay focused on the
								<strong>developer community</strong>
								who are the heart and soul of the
								cloud native
								ecosystem. We are eager to assist developers, particularly from
								end user
								organizations, progress into new roles like contributor and maintainer.
							</p>
									<p>
								In 2019, we will also focus on
								<strong>increased engagement</strong>
								with end users to ensure their voices are represented, their feedback is acted upon, and their organizations are set up for successfully adopting
								cloud native.
							</p>
									<p>
								Our
								<strong>flagship events</strong>
								<a href="http://www.kubecon.io/">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon</a>
								will continue to bring together the community and create opportunities for collaboration. We expect our three events –
								<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2019/">Barcelona </a>
								(May 20-23),
								<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.cn/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-china-2019/">Shanghai</a>
								(June 24-26), and
								<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/">San Diego</a>
								(November 18-21) – to be the best yet. We will help CNCF projects accelerate to reach critical mass and achieve their maximum potential. We will also continue
								<strong>investing</strong>
								in new markets like
								<strong>China and India</strong>
								that are embracing cloud native and open source technologies at a phenomenal rate. Our first
								<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubernetes-day-india-2019/">Kubernetes Day</a>
								event will be in Bengaluru on March 23.
							</p>
									<p>
								Another major focus of 2019 will be helping expand
								cloud native
								technologies to telcos. We will be demonstrating how they can evolve their Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) architectures into Cloud Native Network Functions (CNFs) running on Kubernetes.
							</p>
									<p>
								2018 was a stellar year for CNCF. We are well-positioned both financially and organizationally to continue our
								<strong>mission</strong>
								to make
								<strong>cloud native computing ubiquitous</strong>
								. We look forward to having you join us on this journey as we plan for a blockbuster 2019.
