					<p>The goal of the Linux Foundation, and Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is to share the best software innovations and practices to move technologies, and thereby companies, economies, and societies, forward. The rise of cloud computing, and cloud native computing, comprises one of the largest shifts that the computing industry has seen in decades. There are several benefits of cloud computing. Companies get the computing power that they need when they need it and can scale applications and workloads faster. Additionally, the cloud democratizes resources and makes them more accessible to more companies and entities of all sizes.</p>

					<p>The idea years ago that companies would move all applications to one cloud provider has not panned out, with good reason. Companies cannot afford to have their operations disrupted by cloud or network outages, which often occur. Resiliency in a cloud-defined world means being able to maintain operations under all circumstances and adjust accordingly, especially in the face of unexpected events.</p>

					<p><strong>Multi-Cloud</strong> is the practice of using services (e.g., computing, databases, and networking) from more than one cloud service provider (CSP) at the same time. Multi-Cloud can include public CSPs, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, private clouds, or a combination of the two.</p>

					<p>Despite the advantages of Multi-Cloud, companies struggle to succeed with Multi-Cloud and achieve resilience and optimal operations under all conditions. This emerging arena inspired the Linux Foundation and the CNCF to host the first-ever Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Summit about Multi-Cloud resiliency and how to achieve it.</p>

					<div class="paragraph-quote">
						<p><strong>The May 18, 2022 summit included 21 participants from six business verticals. The participants represented diverse industry sectors and functions, including aeronautics, automotive, semiconductor, insurance, telecommunication, healthcare, business services, technology, banking, fintech and finance, e-commerce, social media, and audio streaming.</strong></p>

						<p><strong>Generally speaking, the participants held leading information technology roles in their companies, ranging from the chief Kubernetes architects to the CTO level.</strong></p>
					</div>

					<p>They all experience Multi-Cloud differently. Some companies deal with it within their organization, while others consult and support their customers on the subject. It is often a combination of both.</p>

					<p><strong>The following criteria were critical:</strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li>Experience in Multi-Cloud and associated
							technologies</li>
						<li>Decision-making and budget accountability </li>
						<li>Cloud native knowledge </li>
					</ul>

					<p>In addition, all participants are consumers of cloud services rather than providers, which the CNCF and the technology industry broadly define as the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/enduser/">end-user community</a>.</p>

					<p>The following report captures the significant findings of the Summit participants, the questions raised, and the concerns that must be addressed.</p>

						<p>Today, Multi-Cloud is a reality for many companies and organizations and will become more so as cloud native architectures mature. The rise of Multi-Cloud is driven by several factors, including mergers and acquisitions that bring different clouds together into one entity and the desire to avoid widespread outages by spreading the workload and risk across multiple clouds.</p>

						<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.flexera.com/blog/cloud/cloud-computing-trends-2022-state-of-the-cloud-report/" title="Cloud Computing Trends 2022 Report">more than 90% of enterprises have a Multi-Cloud strategy</a>, 82% have a hybrid cloud strategy, and more of the same is to come. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused organizations to <a href="https://www.logicmonitor.com/resource/cloud-2025" title="Cloud 2025: The future of workloads in a cloud-first, post-COVID-19 world">accelerate their migration to the cloud</a>.</p>

						<p>Multi-Cloud resiliency means avoiding or mitigating an adverse event's impact and being ready for unexpected outcomes. Achieving Multi-Cloud resiliency requires different approaches than those that are used within a single cloud, no-cloud environments, or even hybrid cloud environments. Finding a path to federate Multi-Cloud architectures is a growing concern for many organizations.</p>

						<p>To paraphrase the Summit participants: <strong>Multi-Cloud is an inevitable and significant challenge.</strong></p>

						<p>In general, the Summit participants agreed that there is a clear need for a Multi-Cloud strategy to govern a rollout. There is also a need for proven best practices to better deal with multiple cloud providers. Best practices should include a framework to exchange ideas and experiences. </p>

						<p>Perhaps most importantly, the Summit participants largely agreed that while there is the potential for better team performance, service availability, and lower operating costs with a Multi-Cloud environment, it has not materialized for many companies. This is because they have varying levels of knowledge and experience in managing multiple cloud environments, building something that is cloud native, handling the exponentially increasing risks that are inherent in Multi-Cloud environments, connecting clouds, and getting data out of a cloud once it is in without a hefty price tag. </p>

						<p>The Summit participants pointed out that challenges grow exponentially when organizations add multiple cloud providers. To achieve Multi-Cloud resiliency, entities need best practices when leveraging people, processes, and technologies. The Summit participants geared their discussion toward offering insights and best practices to help companies and organizations to achieve Multi-Cloud Resiliency.</p>

						<p><strong>We thank all participants for sharing their experiences, knowledge, and insight.</strong></p>

							</li>
							<li>New user groups (UGs) are necessary. Special

						<h3 class="small-header">Technologies</h3>
						<div aria-hidden="true" class="report-spacer-20"></div>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Strong opinions, loosely held</strong>.
								To increase resiliency, accept that the
								solutions that work today may not be the
								solutions that work tomorrow, and solutions at
								the scale that you have today may not be the
								solutions when you scale tomorrow.</li>
							<li><strong>Reduce complexity</strong>. Automation
								can significantly help, i.e., integrating
								governance checks or security tests in the
								delivery pipelines. With Multi-Cloud, different
								approaches and ways of working can cause
								friction among teams, and the presence of
								inconsistent processes hinders teams from doing
								their best. </li>
							<li><strong>Eliminate the "not invented here"
									mindset</strong>. There is no right or wrong
								approach with self-hosted/made vs. managed. It
								depends on your particular setup, organization,
								and business. Decisions must be transparent and
								based on the available skill sets and current
								challenges, including project time frames. The
								right choice today might not be the best
								tomorrow. The solution to the business problem
								should be the driver and not a particular
								technical interest.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Embrace regulatory reality</strong>. We
								all exist in regulated industries, as the
								General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
								impacts everyone. In the future, regulation may
								require a Multi-Cloud approach to lessen the
								impacts of outages and breaches.</li>
							<li><strong>Select where you are going to
									standardize</strong>. To do this, you must
								define your goal of what you want from a cloud
								and your standardization to achieve that goal.
							</li>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>People make the difference</strong>.
								Technology
								will support master challenges, but people will
								implement solutions and drive the necessary
								change.
								Things like end-to-end responsibility are done
								on a
								human level. Technology cannot "go the extra
								mile," but
								people can. Company culture—in general, and in
								particular—plays a key role. Take empowerment
								and
								enablement seriously, i.e. leave technical
								decisions to
								the technicians, and trust the judgment of your
								staff
								with first-hand experience and knowledge.
								Recognize that
								some legacy teams will hinder the progress of
								people
								doing the Kubernetes or cloud-based work because
								they
								are worried about losing their jobs and fear
								change.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Craft an open source strategy and engage
									with
									projects</strong>. Participate in open
								source
								projects to reflect your use cases and needs.
								This can
								also influence the roadmap of vendors. Be
								mindful when
								combining proprietary technology and free and
								open
								source software in a solution or software stack.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Retain and upskill talent</strong>. This
								entails
								<a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/resources/2022-open-source-jobs-report/ "
									title="10th Annual Open Source Jobs Report">attracting
									new team members</a> and keeping the
								existing talent engaged and empowered.
								Multi-Cloud adds
								the additional dimension of needing even more
								skills.
								Furthermore, it includes upskilling and training
								and
								detecting unknown talents within your
								organization and
								developing them.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Use standards and governance as
									frameworks
									without limiting innovation</strong>. A
								means of
								control is needed regarding where the budget is
								spent.
								That is even more true in a Multi-Cloud setup.
								However,
								these frameworks should be seen as guidelines
								rather
								than rigid cages. There should be a place for
								experimentation and trying out new things. </li>

						<li>Consider architecture and design as key. Multi-Cloud
							comes with new challenges and tasks. An example is
							the cross-CSP transfer of information, such as DNS.
							The dependency graphs are becoming very complicated
							to read and manage. The foundation of a solution
							starts at the drawing board. Although seasoned
							experience with a single CSP is handy, it is not
							sufficient. In-depth knowledge of each involved
							cloud is mandatory. </li>

					<ul>
						<li>Recognize that data is both easy and complicated.
							Using Multi-Cloud to duplicate your data on
							different clouds is a positive and so-called easy
							win. The current pricing model supports that.
							However, you should carefully review the ingress and
							egress costs for your use case. The data location
							policy is more complicated. Due to a missing
							cross-CSP abstraction layer, data may end up in the
							wrong place if the specifics of a contributing cloud
							are not fully understood. </li>
						<li>Manage vendor lock-in to your advantage. To minimize
							egress costs, consider grouping the same types of
							business into different clouds. For example, direct
							all mobile connectivity into one cloud and all
							webpage and front end into another cloud. With
							little interaction between the two, the lock-in
							becomes less of an issue, and you can achieve the
							benefits of leveraging the price advantages.</li>

						<p>As the Summit participants noted, Multi-Cloud resiliency is only attainable with changes to the legacy processes, technologies, mindsets, and skillsets. Although it will be a long journey to true resiliency, early results show that the effort will be worth it in terms of an enhanced time to market, faster development cycles, and enhanced capabilities.</p>

						<p><strong>Multi-Cloud and its different aspects are still mostly undiscovered territory</strong>. Over time, we will be able to go deeper in our multi-cloud resiliency skills as we develop our expertise in a collaborative, global environment. Participants left the CTO Summit inspired with fresh perspectives and ideas to bring back to their organizations.</p>

						<p>The open discussions and experience exchange, including the logistics around the event, were very much welcomed by the participants. The following requests for continued collaboration and idea exchange were raised:</p>

						<div aria-hidden="true" class="report-spacer-20"></div>

						<ul>
							<li>Continue the discussion after the event</li>
							<li>Have a framework to easily contact peers or

						<p>The participants received a brief introduction to the Multi-Cloud topic in general and several core elements in particular. This introduction synchronized the expectations of the Summit and served to broaden the understanding of the subject. Additionally, the participants were allowed to vote on which particular aspects of Multi-Cloud to discuss in breakout sessions.</p>

						<p>Three working groups deconstructed two critical topics. After the opening remarks, introductions, and logistics, the participants split up into three designated working groups with dedicated rooms, each separate from the opening plenary discussion area. Given the diversity of the participants, the resulting groups served as a measured representation of the different aspects and viewpoints of Multi-Cloud challenges and experiences across cloud computing.</p>

						<p>Each working group explored two topics and evaluated three key areas. Following a vote by a show of hands, the following sub-topics were selected and discussed separately:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>How to best manage the cloud native ecosystem in
								any
								organization</li>
							<li>Multi-Cloud availability</li>
						</ul>

						<p>To facilitate the discussion, the groups followed a common framework to focus their discussion using the following three key areas: </p>

						<ul>
							<li>Expand on or define the problem statement of the
								selected sub-topic.</li>
							<li>Solution design
								<ul>
									<li>People</li>
									<li>Processes</li>
									<li>Technology</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Priorities</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The working group facilitators sparked discussion, managed the flow of ideas and solution design, and recorded the breakout group's key findings. There was one dedicated session per topic for each working group. Afterward, each group reported back on their results to the Summit participants, and then an open discussion ensued.</p>

						<p><strong>Multi-Cloud management</strong><br/>Multi-Cloud is inevitable. It creeps in through best-of-breed services, company acquisitions, and just plain sprawl. In such a world, managing Kubernetes clusters, computing, and applications across multiple clouds require a unique set of tools and comprehensive workflows. Using strategies like GitOps and declarative infrastructure creates consistent environments, which are essential for operating systems at scale. This discussion aims to understand which kinds of workflow teams should implement to allow for massive infrastructure scaling without massively scaling team sizes or budgets.</p>

						<p><strong>Managing the cloud native ecosystem in your organization</strong><br/>Do you use a CNCF project by itself? There are unique challenges when running and configuring a project directly rather than through a managed service. The cloud native ecosystem has a vibrant community of particular interest, working, and technical action groups that create boundless updates across the ecosystem that can be difficult to keep up with. During this session, we will cover the practices that high-performance teams implement to stay up to date on project updates without wasting their time.</p>

						<p><strong>What tenets of Multi-Cloud are essential for business?</strong><br/>Although cloud native technologies can help to support workload, workflow, data, and traffic portability, which tenants of Multi-Cloud are the most beneficial? Do you care about workflows that allow a consistent experience building applications, computing, networks, and storage? Maybe you'd like to write an application consistently and have the platform be dynamically configurable to meet your needs. In this session, we will discover which approaches are most beneficial to teams that operate at a Multi-Cloud scale, including examples of success that have been shared by our program committee from Boeing, Fidelity, Intel, and Intuit.</p>

						<p><strong>Multi-Cloud availability</strong><br/>Many services, such as DNS, CDNs, and artifact storage, can be instantiated in public or private clouds. Despite many of these services being offered in major public clouds, relying on managed services does not always make sense when resiliency is the end goal. Which services make the most sense to run as managed services or federate between your various cloud offerings? This session will cover which services are requirements for achieving a resilient Multi-Cloud platform that promotes regular iteration and improvement.</p>
