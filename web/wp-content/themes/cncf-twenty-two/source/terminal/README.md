# CNCF Theme for Terminal

To celebrate the new CNCF website design, we've released a MacOS Terminal theme inspired by the websites color palette.

## Download CNCF Theme

[Download the CNCF.terminal file](https://raw.github.com/cncf/cncf.io/main/web/wp-content/themes/cncf-twenty-two/source/terminal/CNCF.terminal).

## Activating the theme

1. Open Terminal
2. Go to Settings
2. Click the "Gear" icon
3. Click Import...
4. Select the CNCF.terminal file
5. Click Default

You can also open the CNCF.terminal file directly by clicking on it, but this will not set the theme as default, so your Terminal theme will reset when re-opened.

If you have any feedback please open an issue in this repo.
