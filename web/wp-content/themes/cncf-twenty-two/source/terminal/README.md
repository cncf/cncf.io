# CNCF Theme for Terminal

To celebrate the new CNCF website design, we've released a MacOS Terminal theme inspired by the new color palette.

## Download CNCF Theme

[Download the CNCF.terminal file](https://raw.github.com/cncf/cncf.io/main/web/wp-content/themes/cncf-twenty-two/source/terminal/CNCF.terminal.zip).

## Activating the theme

1. Open Terminal
2. Go to "Preferences..."
2. In "Profiles" tab, click the "..." icon at the bottom of the list of themes and then "Import..."
4. Select the CNCF.terminal file
5. Click Default

Now when you open a new Terminal window it will use the CNCF theme.
