# Contributing to CNCF.io

Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project. We've created a document that describes guidelines for [contributing to the CNCF.io git repository](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# CNCF.io Developer Instructions

These instructions are based on you having access to the CNCF.io Pantheon account (and the CNCF.io WordPress database).

## Install Local Instance

### Requirements

* Install [Lando](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases) (a Docker Compose utility / abstraction layer). Using Homebrew for installation is not recommended. [Lando Docs](https://docs.devwithlando.io/). Lando includes it's own versions of PHP, Node (14.19.0), NPM.

* When setting up Lando with the Pantheon recipe it will automatically download [Terminus](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/install/) (CLI for interaction with Pantheon).  Follow all the instructions on that page to setup a [machine token](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/install/#machine-token) and [SSH Authentication](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/install/#ssh-authentication). Save the machine token for use in step 2 below.

* Get a GitHub [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) to use in place of a password for performing Git operations over HTTPS.

### Lando Setup
(these steps were derived from [instructions provided by Pantheon](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-wordpress-composer#working-locally-with-lando))

1. Clone this repository with HTTPS (not SSH): `git clone https://github.com/cncf/cncf.io.git`
  * Note that the repo does not contain all of WordPress, 3rd-party themes and plugins. They will be pulled in via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) in step 4.

2. Run `lando init` and use the following values when prompted:
  * `From where should we get your app's codebase?` > `current working directory`
  * `What recipe do you want to use?` > `pantheon`
  * `Enter a Pantheon machine token` > `[enter the Pantheon token you got above]`
  * `Which site?` > `cncfci`

3. Open the .lando.yml file and add the following to the file.

```yml

proxy:
  node:
    - bs.cncfci.lndo.site:3000
excludes:
  - vendor
  - /app/web/wp-content/themes/cncf-twenty-two/node_modules
services:
  node:
    type: 'node:14'
    ssl: true
    scanner: false
  appserver:
    run:
      - /app/vendor/bin/phpcs --config-set installed_paths /app/vendor/wp-coding-standards/wpcs
      - /app/vendor/bin/phpcs -i
tooling:
  npm:
    service: node
  npx:
    service: node
  node:
    service: node
  phpcs:
    service: appserver
    cmd: /app/vendor/bin/phpcs
    description: 'Run PHPCS commands'
  phpcbf:
    service: appserver
    cmd: /app/vendor/bin/phpcbf
    description: 'Run PHPCBF commands'
  sniff:
    service: appserver
    cmd: /app/vendor/bin/phpcs -n -s --ignore="*/build/*,*/dist/*,*/node_modules/*,*gulpfile*,*/uploads/*,*/plugins/*,*/scripts/*,*/vendor/*,*pantheon*,/build/globals.js" -d memory_limit=1024M --standard="WordPress" /app/web/wp-content/themes/
    description: 'Run the recommended code sniffs'
  fix:
    service: appserver
    cmd: /app/vendor/bin/phpcbf -n -s --ignore="*/build/*,*/dist/*,*/node_modules/*,*gulpfile*,*/uploads/*,*/plugins/*,*/scripts/*,*/vendor/*,*pantheon*,/build/globals.js" -d memory_limit=1024M --standard="WordPress" /app/web/wp-content/themes/
    description: 'Run the recommended code sniffs and fix'
  debug:
    service: appserver
    cmd: 'touch /app/web/wp-content/debug.log && tail -f /app/web/wp-content/debug.log'
    description: 'Get real-time WP debug log output'

```

If you are running a Silicon Mac (M1 / M2), you need to specify the database type, inserted after node in services.

```yml

services:
  node:
    type: 'node:14'
  database:
    type: mariadb:10.3
    portforward: 52357

```

4. Run `lando start` and note the local site URL provided at the end of the process.

5. Run `lando composer install --no-ansi --no-interaction --optimize-autoloader --no-progress` to download dependencies

6. Run `lando pull --code=none` and follow the prompts to download the media files and database from Pantheon:
  * `Pull database from?` >  `dev`
  * `Pull files from?` >  `dev`

  (Note: The files could be over 10Gb in size. It may be better to select 'none' and then load the images from the remote server.)

7. You will need to compile the theme css/js before the site will render correctly:
   1. Go to the theme directory: `cd web/wp-content/themes/cncf-twenty-two`
   2. Install the Node.js dependencies: `lando npm install`
   3. Compile the files: `lando npm run build`

8. Visit the local site URL saved from above. To find it again run `lando info`.

9. In the admin you will need to edit the [Search & Filter](https://cncfci.lndo.site/wp/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=search-filter-widget) settings.  The full url to the result pages are hardcoded in the "Display Results" of each filter.  These will need to be set to the correpsonding local instance url.

10. Get your browser to trust the Lando SSL certificate by following [these instructions](https://docs.lando.dev/config/security.html#trusting-the-ca).  This step isn't essential but will stop you having to keep bypassing the privacy warning in your browser.  On MacOS, you may also need to manually go into Keychain Access and set the ```*.lndo.site``` certificate to “Always Trust”. See [screenshot](/ca-screenshot.png).

### Notes

* You can stop Lando with `lando stop` and start it again with `lando start`. You can turn it off completely with `lando poweroff`

* Composer, Terminus, npm and wp-cli commands should be run in Lando rather than on the host machine. This is done by prefixing the desired command with `lando`. For example, after a change to composer.json, run `lando composer update` rather than `composer update`.

* Run `lando pull --code=none` at any time to pull down a fresh copy of the database and files from the live instance on Pantheon

## Theme Development

To activate Browsersync to watch files, run `lando npm start` in the theme directory. You will then be able to browse the bs.* url listed previously and see the site auto-update whenever there is a change in the underlying source code.

-----

## Code Sniffs

The CircleCI process will sniff the code to make sure it complies with WordPress coding standards.  All Linux Foundation code should comply with [these guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TYqCwG874i6PdJDf5UX9gnCZaarvf121G1GdNH7Vl5k/edit#heading=h.dz20heii56uf).

phpcs and the [WordPress Coding Standards for PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards) come as part of the repo and are installed in the vendor directory by composer.

To run recommended tests:

```
lando sniff
```

To run recommended tests and fix issues automatically:

```
lando fix
```

To access  phpcs or phpcbf on the command line to run your own commands, you can access them via Lando, for instance:

```
lando phpcs -i
```

## Upgrading WordPress core, themes and plugins

The dependencies of this project are managed by [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). All dependencies of the project are set in [composer.json](https://github.com/cncf/cncf.io/blob/main/composer.json) and are pulled in at deploy time according to what is set in [composer.lock](https://github.com/cncf/cncf.io/blob/main/composer.lock).

composer.lock is generated from composer.json only when explicitly calling the `lando composer update` function. Any additional themes or plugins can be added first to composer.json and then `lando composer update` is run to update composer.lock and pull in the new files.  Dependencies are pegged to a version according to the composer [versioning rules](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md).

It's good practice to keep WordPress and all plugins set at their latest releases to inherit any security patches and upgraded functionality.  Upgrading to a new version, however, sometimes has unintended consequences so it's critical to run all tests before deploying live.
